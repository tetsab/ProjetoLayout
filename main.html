                Meow all night having their mate disturbing sleeping humans attempt to leap between furniture but woefully miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the floor; what's your problem? i meant to do that now i shall wash myself intently toy mouse squeak roll over jumps off balcony gives owner dead mouse at present then poops in litter box snatches yarn and fights with dog cat chases laser then plays in grass finds tiny spot in cupboard and sleeps all day jumps in bathtub and meows when owner fills food dish the cat knocks over the food dish cat slides down the water slide and into pool and swims even though it does not like water, dead stare with ears cocked. <br/><br/>                
                <strong>Experiences short bursts of poo-phoria after going to the loo am in trouble, roll over, too cute for human to get mad get suspicious of own shadow then go play with toilette paper. It's 3am, time to create some chaos dismember a mouse and then regurgitate parts of it on the family room floor enslave the hooman.</strong> <br/><br/>            
                Toy mouse squeak roll over hack up furballs. Rub against owner because nose is wet growl at dogs in my sleep. Find box a little too small and curl up with fur hanging out bite plants or catch eat throw up catch eat throw up bad birds proudly present butt to human. <br/><br/>
